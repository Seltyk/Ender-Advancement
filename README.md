# Ender Advancement
The Ender Advancement mod for Minecraft 1.12, which I didn't actually ever want to update to. Well I did it anyways  

---
Installation:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/wundrweapon/Ender-Advancement.git --branch 1.12 --single-branch <name>` replacing <name> with the name for your folder
2. Extract the `forge-1.12-14.21.1.2387.zip` contents into your new folder
3. From here, ready the environment as usual
4. Delete the 7 text documents Forge supplies. They're already on this repo in their own folder. Also delete `src/main/java/com/*`
