# Ender Advancement
The Ender Advancement mod for Minecraft 1.12.2, now with slightly fewer issues!

At the end of commits may be some parentheses with letters in them. Those letters are to be in alphabetical order, lower case, and separated by "/". If some mark (like u) is made obvious by the presence of a more prominent mark (like e), then the less prominent mark should not be present. Example: (c/n) marks that some changes have been shown to cause a game crash or hang, and others just aren't working right. No marks mean the changes have been tested and show no signs of problems

* c: crashes or hangs in-game somewhere
* e: contains compiler errors
* f: game fails to launch
* n: some feature(s) not working as intended, but feature(s) in question do not cause the game to crash/hang
* u: untested
